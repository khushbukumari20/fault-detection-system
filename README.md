Intelligent Home Security: Anomaly Classification in Smart Home Data 
using Machine Learning Classifiers 
The application of machine learning-based fault detection systems in IoT-based smart homes 
has wide-ranging implications for enhancing cybersecurity and safeguarding user privacy. By 
accurately identifying and mitigating potential faults, these systems enable homeowners to 
protect their personal data, sensitive information, and physical assets from unauthorized access 
or malicious activities. Additionally, the deployment of intelligent fault detection systems 
contributes to the overall resilience of smart home ecosystems, ensuring uninterrupted 
functionality and enhancing user trust in IoT technologies. Current approaches to fault 
detection in smart homes often rely on rule-based systems or signature-based methods, which 
may struggle to adapt to evolving cyber threats and sophisticated attack techniques. These 
traditional methods may also generate false positives or false negatives, leading to inefficient 
use of resources or overlooked security breaches. Furthermore, the increasing complexity and 
interconnectedness of IoT devices within smart homes exacerbate the challenges associated 
with fault detection, requiring more robust and scalable solutions to address emerging threats 
effectively. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed intelligent fault detection system 
utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify network traffic data in IoT-based 
smart homes. By leveraging the rich feature set provided by the dataset, including connection 
metrics and interaction patterns, the proposed system can learn complex patterns indicative of 
both normal and anomalous behavior within smart home networks.  Additionally, this work 
explores the integration of anomaly detection methods and ensemble learning strategies to 
enhance the accuracy and robustness of fault detection system.
